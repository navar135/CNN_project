## Project Objective
- We created three different convolutional neural networks with increasing number of layers to test their accuracy on varying versions of the MNIST datasets which wwere processd with varying levels of noise

## Methods Used
- Machine Learning 
- Data Visualization

## Technologies Used
- The project was created using python and using the following packages: 
  * TensorFlow
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Sklearn
## Data Source
- [MNIST Dataset (from Keras packages)](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz)
